# **8Base** 
---
8base was built to make developers' and innovators' lives easier. We accomplish this by continually abstracting away redundant and low-value add work, while never taking away a developer's ability to take full control if they so desire.

Modern applications require full front-end freedom in order digitally enable customer experiences. 8base balances backend control with front-end freedom to the delight of all involved.
